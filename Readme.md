Obio is an open-face-chinese-poker game I am creating

The first part of the game called recruitment is very similar to Pineapple Open-Face-Chinese-Poker where you build a hand and it is given a point value to determine its strength

Your hand then becomes an army that you use to attack any opposing players army. The strength of your hand is used as an hp and as you are attacked and lose cards you lose health. 

Your army is not dead until all of your cards are removed but having no health means you are useless. Just bodies on the battlefield. 

The reason you are still in the game is different seasons bring health bonuses for different factions(suits of cards) possibly giving your army health and your cards that were out but weren't killed may be able to attack again.

The shape of the battlefield is just simply the three rows of cards but withenough room for four players. A Spot for the deck in the center and sliders for health behind each army. I want the game board to have detailed instructions on hand building and attacking.
